# Security boundary and upstream dependencies

This beta is a local, authenticated OpenClaw distribution with a reviewed plugin
and native Timechain orchestrator. Functional tests do not establish perfect
security, truthful model judgment or an absence of dependency vulnerabilities.

The installed UI initially authenticates with an expiring, single-use launcher
nonce. Same-tab reload can use a rotating opaque resume credential stored in
local-origin `sessionStorage`. That credential grants access to the same live
session; it is sensitive even though no provider API key or API bearer is saved
there. Resume requires both owner proof and the exact local Origin. Merely
forging loopback Origin/fetch headers cannot create a session. Session end,
expiry and runtime restart invalidate the grant; closing a tab is not a reliable
server-side revocation signal. The embedded auditor is trusted same-origin UI,
not a sandbox boundary. Its messaging protocol deliberately forwards only fixed
reads and never sends the model key or parent bearer into the frame.

The original OpenClaw npm archive stays at the exact commitment in
`upstream-lock.json` (OpenClaw 2026.10.10). The extracted runtime has one explicit
metadata compatibility overlay, `early-hook-input-provenance-v2`: it forwards
only existing `inputProvenance: params.inputProvenance` and
`currentSourceTurnId: params.currentSourceTurnId` into the embedded-agent and CLI
runner's same early hook contexts. These typed native fields preserve private
asynchronous producer provenance and the framework's original client nonce for
queued-request correlation before mandatory PoI admission. Text markers and
transport acknowledgments never substitute for that provenance. No model, permission, tool or
safety semantics are changed. Installers check both exact original SHA-256
values before replacement; doctor and Gateway require both exact final hashes.
Unknown source bytes, earlier overlay output or a new upstream version fail closed. The original npm
SRI describes the downloaded archive; the separate overlay descriptors attest
the two installed files. A separate, exact dependency overlay selects external
Undici 8.12.3, Zod 4.6.7, npm 12.2.1 and Minimatch 11.0.4. These are ordinary dependency overrides,
not edits to the upstream source tarball. The runtime lockfile, setup integrity
checks and launcher doctor validate these selections. Adoption requires actual
Gateway and installed-application regression tests. Automatic upstream update
checks and automatic application of updates are disabled in the managed Gateway.

The external overrides do not replace embedded dependency copies. A separate
`bundledDependencyOverlays` commitment installs official, hash-verified,
same-major Undici 6.29.1 and ip-address 10.7.6 archives into npm's own bundled
dependency directories after `npm ci --ignore-scripts`. Both platform installers
apply these archives; launcher doctor verifies the actual installed versions.
This replaces whole published dependency packages without editing their source.
It is distinct from the two-file OpenClaw metadata overlay above. The downloaded
npm archive and its upstream lock metadata still
describe the original bundled copies, so a raw upstream-lock audit is not a
measurement of these separately verified installed replacements.

Residual embedded findings remain:

- OpenClaw's compiled schema bundles contain Zod 4.6.5. The upstream collection
  bounds fix checks limits before parsing elements; replacing the external Zod
  npm package does not apply that fix to embedded code. See the
  [upstream Zod fix](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod/commit/a0ebf970f2d752e5f58527cd2942ff48be4f46bd).
- npm 12.2.1's published archive bundles Undici 6.29.0. The
  [Undici advisory](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/security/advisories/GHSA-xjj6-f33q-929c)
  specifies fixed 6.x version 6.29.1, which the separate bundled archive overlay
  applies. A top-level override alone does not fix this copy. The bundled
  ip-address denial-of-service finding is likewise addressed by its verified
  10.7.6 same-major replacement. The npm package-manager dependency tree retains
  other moderate audit findings. The
  [npm release notes](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v12.2.1)
  do not establish that all its bundled dependencies are fixed.
- The external Minimatch override includes the
  [globparts amplification fix](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch/security/advisories/GHSA-g3hv-75wg-m249).
  npm's bundled Minimatch 10.2.5 and Glob 13.0.6 remain separate: their published
  fixes require new major versions and different dependency trees. They have
  not been silently replaced with incompatible majors. The original locked tree
  reported 34 moderate and one high findings before the explicit bundled
  replacements; that raw lock report is retained as upstream evidence, with
  replacement verification reported separately. No lock metadata is rewritten
  to hide a vulnerable published npm bundle.

The managed UI does not expose npm/package-manager tools. Host tools are
default-denied and require explicit per-agent grants, scope validation and fresh
semantic/native admission before each invocation. Exploratory search branches
and utility calls cannot use them. Gateway HTTP is authenticated and bound to numeric loopback; the UI never
receives its operator token. ChainChat constructs Gateway message envelopes,
limits them to 200 messages and sends no arbitrary browser-provided tool or
configuration schemas. Browser chat input becomes message text. The reviewed
HTTP schema uses unknown message/tool elements rather than the constrained
collection route identified in the Zod fix. Review found no identified path from
the current UI to that specific oversized-collection exploit. This is a scoped
reachability assessment, not proof that every embedded schema is safe.

The provider proxy bounds responses, refuses redirects and strips transport
encoding headers when forwarding decoded content. Provider credentials remain
in the parent process; the child receives private proxy credentials. Native
admission and exact candidate receipts remain required regardless of model
output. Default-denied tools are not an OS sandbox: explicitly approved native
operator code still runs with the local user's permissions.

Do not expose the Gateway or ChainChat HTTP ports publicly or treat arbitrary
standalone OpenClaw plugins, channels, CLI commands or tools as covered by this
configuration's tests. Extending those paths requires a fresh security review.
Use `npm audit --omit=dev` in `openclaw/runtime` when reviewing updates, inspect
embedded libraries as well as lockfile findings, and test a reviewed upstream
release containing those fixes before removing the residual notices. An audit
with zero lockfile findings would not itself prove embedded copies are fixed.


## Native controls and explicit local tools

Automatic native utility routing is disabled with `agents.defaults.utilityModel:
""`, and native remote memory indexing/search is disabled with
`memory.search.enabled: false`. Upstream otherwise derives utility models from
the global native provider and defaults memory embeddings to OpenAI, independently
of the selected chat tier. A separate explicit owner setting grant can enable
either native feature. That route has its own provider cost and privacy terms,
including while chat uses Free. Private PoI SDK review still uses the expressly
selected native main model; these defaults do not bypass or disable review.

Free and BYOK native agent runs, including admitted children, are routed to the
owner's exact private proxy provider before native model selection. Their native
fallback chain is empty; a saved native profile cannot become a paid fallback.
The mandatory context engine independently checks the actual public native
runtime provider/model metadata before supplying any model context. Missing or
mismatched metadata triggers the existing owned-process fail-stop. Route lookup
can read a host-registered claim before native admission, but cannot bind its
run ID, prepare context, grant tools or revive a completed candidate. Native
provider mode retains explicitly configured native model overrides.
When upstream selects a continuation model before forwarding its full typed
input, a read-only routing hint may use an actually observed task/creation
receipt or an enrolled native source. Media hints recheck the exact parent
session, lifecycle and receipt epoch. They do not parse message text, reserve a
task or create a Timechain. The current owner connection is checked separately;
later admission still requires the complete native source proof and fresh
model-route verification before inference.

Recurring heartbeats require the native Automations scheduler and an explicitly
enrolled owner source. The source's monitor-note editor uses only the actual
system heartbeat job and upstream compare-and-swap scratch APIs. It rechecks
enrollment, native configuration and the exact monitor before and after each
read/write. Editing requires the owner's current background grant; reading or
revoking an owned source remains available after a grant is disabled. Notes
are prompt data, never tool authority. Upstream intentionally skips scheduled
model work for an empty scratch; removing the scratch restores the configured
heartbeat prompt. Each admitted turn still receives canonical policy and fresh
semantic/native review.

Native goals/preferences have durable local session state. Direct BYOK keys and local
session authority remain in parent-process memory; native provider sign-in uses
OpenClaw's private local credential store and may persist keys or OAuth tokens there.
Persistent native authentication is not cleared by closing a browser tab or stopping
the app. Dedicated TTS credentials use a separate plaintext local
`native-secrets.json` store, with owner-only file/directory modes on POSIX and the
installation's user-profile ACLs on Windows. This is not an encrypted vault.
Only configured native TTS provider/persona targets are accepted; settings hold
official `SecretInput` references to generated, exactly allowlisted child
environment names. Public state never contains the credential values. Deleting a
binding removes it from the managed child on the next owned restart. Shared free
credentials remain only on the hosted relay. The operator token never reaches
the browser. Native schema inspection is redacted; edits cannot remove required
PoI enforcement or replace managed credentials, plugins or gateway bindings.
Deterministic native slash-command results are control output, not model answers
or fabricated conversation seals.

Granting exec/process permits broad execution as the local OS user. Directory and
requested-host lists do not sandbox arbitrary subprocesses. File grants are
canonicalized, reject symlink escapes and protect application/data/paired-chain
roots. Browser automation uses an owned profile and a managed authenticated
network proxy; requested-navigation checks alone cannot contain DNS changes,
redirects and page subresources. Each native primitive action receives fresh
semantic/native review. Compound actions and unverifiable cross-origin frame
references are held. Model-supplied JavaScript requires the separate broad
evaluation, credential and payment acknowledgments; it is not keyword-sandboxed.
Web-fetch grants retain
native DNS/private-network checks and disable redirects. These checks do not
constitute a system firewall or OS sandbox. Native channel text and scheduled
turns use explicit immutable bindings and the shared review/commit pipeline;
separate outgoing permits expire on source, local-session or provider revocation.

Compaction requires an exact-source summary receipt and native transcript CAS.
Private, per-invocation model-route capabilities identify proxy-mode invocations
and are stripped before provider forwarding. Native provider mode does not add
these proxy markers; it uses private session and assembly receipts. Missing reviewed
context, including a legacy engine fallback, cannot authorize model generation.
The mandatory factory is probed before startup is reported ready and before
native work/provider forwarding. Its guard latches faults without selecting a
legacy writer. Unexpected accepted-turn commit failures stop the owned Gateway
before native exception recovery; constructor-fault tests verify no deterministic
compaction append, even when no model call would have occurred.

Browser proxy credentials remain in the parent. The private CDP relay answers
only authentication challenges marked Proxy from the exact owned endpoint;
website authentication does not receive that credential. Capability-bound
discovery validates the actual owned browser/page endpoints. Real two-client
HTTPS and origin Basic-auth checks accompany bounded protocol, queue, shutdown
and revocation tests. This transport does not sandbox trusted native plugin code.

The pinned first-party browser backend is a required service; its original
tool receives mandatory parameter scoping, PoI review and result reduction. Third-party native plugins require explicit exact
artifact trust and native lifecycle consent. **They execute with the local user's
OS permissions and can act outside model hooks.** PoI gates model actions, not
arbitrary trusted plugin code. Do not treat importing a chain, enabling a tool,
or passing deterministic tests as a native-plugin sandbox or proof of security.
